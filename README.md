# ExoInt
Rocky planets as devolatilized stars (Source codes for Wang et al. 2019, MNRAS, doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty2749). Purpose: devolatilize stellar abundances to produce rocky exoplanetary bulk composition, with which constrain the modelling of the exoplanet interiors. 

The codes, named temporarily “ExoInt”, are created and maintained by Haiyang S. Wang.

The codes are currently written in IDL, and a Python version will be coming soon. 

Please run the codes starting with ‘exoconstraints.pro’. 

The examples that are given in the codes include the Sun, Kepler-10, Kepler-20, Kepler-21, and Kepler-100 as presented in Wang et al. 2019 (MNRAS). 
 
You may feel free to add any other stellar abundances (in dex, relative to the Sun). 

The modelling results of the mantle and core composition as well as core mass fraction of potential/postulated terrestrial exoplanets in orbiting the star of your interest will be output under the folder “outputs”.
