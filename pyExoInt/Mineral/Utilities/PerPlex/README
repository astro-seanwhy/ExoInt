This version of PerPlex is 6.8.9, the binary and data files of which are distributed here under the courtesy of James Connolly. We have compiled it on a Linux system. 

If you would like to use this version of PerPlex on a different system (e.g., MAC or Windows) or adopt any recent versions (particuarly from 6.9.1), please follow the instruction of Perple_x, https://www.perplex.ethz.ch/ , to obtain the relevant files to compile them on your system. 
We have included an updated makefile, which has been tested to be compitable with the latest MacOS Tahoe system and Rocky Linux 9.6 (Blue Onyx). 
We unfortunately cannot offer further help on compiling Perplex.
