pyExoInt is a python version of ExoInt_v1.2 (IDL) -- A devolatilization and interior modeling package for rocky planets, which is created and maintained by Haiyang S. Wang (HSW) and is copyrighted with the GNU GPLv3 open-acess license (unless specified otherwise for some modules). 

Disclaimer: 
"""
The python version is not be guaranteed to be identical to the IDL version of the original ExoInt_v1.2, but it contains all the main features of the original code and may be useful to users who are more familiar with the Python language.

It was co-developed by Haiyang S. Wang and Fabian L. Seidler @ 2021-2022.
It has been further modified and maintained by Haiyang S. Wang @ 2022-2023.

------------------- Running ExoInt --------------------
To run pyExoInt, start with 'exoconstraints.py', which calls the function 'exomodel' from 'exomodel.py'. "chemsysmodel" is further called by "exomodel".

----render stellar abundances------------
--Please format your stellar abundances to be differential, i.e., [X/H], as the example files (including the header)
--examplestar1 has symmetric error bars while examplestar2 has asymmetric error bars 
--and place them in the folder 'data/stellar_abu/' (by default)

----output ------
The final results are stored in the "output" folder, and are named by the filename of the input stellar abundances, followed with suffixes '_results.csv' and '_results_formated.txt' -- i.e. two different files with identical results.
In addition, three seperated files -- ...mantlecomp_final.txt, corecomp_final.txt, and fcoremass_final.txt -- are also generated, which may be called for the subsequent mineral modellling through the code "Mineral" (read further instructions there)
